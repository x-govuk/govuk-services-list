## How to add or update screenshots

Screenshots for service landing or home pages can be added automatically by running a script.

First, you need to have the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed.

To tell the script where the Google Chrome executable is located on your computer, create a file named `.env` (in the same folder as this `README.md` file) and add this named environment variable:

`GOOGLE_CHROME_PATH=""`

For example, on a Mac, this may be something like this:

`GOOGLE_CHROME_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"`

Once this is set up, you can run the script to add the screenshots using this command:

`npm run screenshots register-to-vote`

Substitute `register-to-vote` with the name of the file for the service you want to screenshot.

You can also update all the screenshots (which will take a while) by running this command:

`npm run screenshots all`

Screenshots will be saved in the `app/assets/images/service-screenshots` folder, using the same name as the json file within `app/services`. Images are all 2160×2160 pixels (1080x1080 at 2× resolution), and will be rendered with no cookies set (so will include any cookie banner).
