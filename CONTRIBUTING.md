# Contribution guidelines

We really like contributions and bug reports, in fact the project wouldn’t have got to this stage without them.

We do have a few guidelines to bear in mind.

## Raising bugs

When raising bugs please explain the issue in good detail and provide a guide to how to replicate it.

When describing the bug it’s useful to follow the format:

- what you did
- what you expected to happen
- what happened

## Suggesting features

Please raise feature requests as issues before contributing any code.

This is to ensure they are discussed properly before any time is spent on them.

## Contributing code

### Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs please. No trailing whitespace.

### Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and bump the version
on `main`. Please don’t submit your own proposed version numbers.

### Commit hygiene

Please see our [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md) which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.
