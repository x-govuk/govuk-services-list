  "description": "You can get certain official UK documents ‘legalised’ by asking the Legalisation Office to confirm that the signature, stamp or seal is from a UK public official. You might need to do this if an official in another country has asked you to provide a UK document and they’ve said it must be legalised. The Legalisation Office will check the document, including whether the signature, stamp or seal is genuine. They’ll legalise the document by attaching a stamped official certificate (an ‘apostille’) to it. You can’t get documents issued outside the UK legalised using this service - get them legalised in the country they were issued.",
